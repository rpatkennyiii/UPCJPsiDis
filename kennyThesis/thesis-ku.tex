\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  In ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions, photon-induced interactions between
    colliding nuclei occur at large impact parameters.
  In this thesis, a study of \JPsi{} photoproduction in ultra-peripheral PbPb 
    collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76$ TeV is presented.
  This was carried out using data collected by the Compact Muon Solenoid in 
    2011. 
  An integrated luminosity of 143 $\mu$$b^{-1}$ was analyzed for this thesis
    using specifically designed triggers.
  The cross section for coherent \JPsi{} photoproduction in the single sided
    break-up mode, $\frac{d\sigma^{J/\psi}}{dy}(Xn0n)$, was measured in the 
    rapidity interval $2.0 < |y| < 2.2$ and was found to be 
    356 $\pm$ 71 (stat) $^{+43}_{-50}$ (syst) $\mu$b.
  The total cross section, after correcting for break-up mode, 
    is found to be 1.80 $\pm$ 0.37 (stat) $^{+0.22}_{-0.25}$ (syst) mb, in 
    agreement with theoretical predictions and previous measurements by the 
    ALICE collaboration.
  The cross section measurement is consistent with \JPsi{} photoproduction 
    models that contain significant nuclear gluon shadowing.
  In addition, the correlation between the \JPsi{}'s and neutrons 
    rapidities was measured and found to qualitatively agree with recent 
    theoretical calculations. 
  The measured rapidity correlation provides a way to distinguish between 
    coherent and incoherent \JPsi{} photoproduction.

  It has been a long road.
  I find it shocking to think that it is really done. 
  It is pretty surreal to see Dr. Pat on things, but I can't say I mind.
  Actually, it feels pretty good.  

  My parents met at KU, so I've been a Jayhawk since the day I was born.
  I owe much of what I've accomplished to The University of Kansas.
  Both my undergraduate and graduate careers took place within the nurturing 
    environment of the KU physics department.
  I can't imagine a more supportive place to have grown from a student to a 
    physicist. 

  Dave Besson gave me my first opportunity to really ``do'' physics research 
    as an undergraduate.
  I am immensely grateful for the experience. 
  The things I learned in his lab have been invaluable to me in my academic 
    career.
  Thank you for giving me a chance.
  
  I began working with my advisor, Michael Murray, during my second year of 
    graduate school.
  His unique combination of patience and pushiness, his soft spoken voice, but 
    firm resolve, provided me with both the space and direction that I needed
    to become the researcher I am today. 
  In particular, I am especially thankful for the encouragement and support 
    Michael provided, which convinced me to take my family to CERN when I 
    didn't think it was possible. 
  My time at CERN was the most formative time in my development as researcher.
  Thanks you for your support. 

  At CERN, I met Magdalena Malek. 
  If not for her, the data for this thesis would not have been recorded nor 
    would the analysis have gotten off the ground.
  Her tenacity is awe inspiring. 
  It was her drive that taught me what it takes to do science at the highest
    level.
  Thanks you for pushing me. 

  When Daniel Tapia Takaki came to KU, he brought the energy and excitement of 
    CERN with him. 
  His enthusiasm is infectious.
  Daniel worked with me when I thought I could not go any further. 
  Without Daniel, this thesis never would have been completed. 
  Thank you for showing me how to close. 

  My family is the foundation for everything I do. 
  My parents always encouraged me to be thoughtful, creative, and idealistic. 
  This is what cultivated the mindset I needed to pursue physics.
  The love of my mom and dad, and the support of my step-mom, Jerry, and my 
    in-laws have sustained me when times were difficult.
  My mom's commitment to my education is something I only hope I can replicate
    for my own children. 
   
  My children are what give my life meaning. 
  Declan, Rowan: I love you.
  My wife has been my biggest supporter, my last bastion of sanity, and love of 
    my life.
  Thank you so very much for traveling on this long road with me.
