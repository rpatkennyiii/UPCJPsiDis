\chapter{The CMS Detector}	
  CMS is housed at interaction point 5 of the LHC. 
  The LHC is designed to pursue physics at the TeV scale. 
  This is the scale where electroweak symmetry breaking is believed to occur
  	\cite{CmsPTdrv2}.
  While this means that the search for the standard model Higgs is the central 
  	driving design consideration, the wide range of possibilities for
  	finding new physics signals requires a general purpose detector.
  The expedient discovery of new physics through low cross section interactions 
  	requires high luminosity.
  This consideration leads inevitably to pile up, where multiple collisions 
  	occurs at a single bunch crossing.
  At peak luminosity the LHC is expected to produce on average 20 hard 
  	proton-proton (pp) collisions per bunch crossing \cite{tCmsE}.
  These particle physics considerations of high multiplicity due to pileup and the
  	need for a general purpose detector make CMS serendipitously well suited
  	for heavy ion physics.

    \label{cms}
  \end{figure}
  
  The general purpose design of CMS is dominated by the massive 4T 
  	superconducting solenoid at its core.
  The magnets is 13m long with a 6m diameter, and pushes the limits of power
  	and compactness \cite{tCmsE}. 
  These two conflicting limits are achieved through the novel design of 
  	interweaving structural and conducting elements together in the coil of
  	the solenoid.

  Within the solenoid resides three different sub detectors.
  The inner most is the world's largest silicon tracker \cite{tCmsE}.
  The tracker is surrounded by a highly effective lead tungstate crystal 
    electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL).
  ECAL is encapsulated in a brass scintillating hadronic calorimeter (HCAL).
  Outside the magnet, muon chambers are used to aid in the measurement and 
    triggering of muon events. 
  Altogether CMS weighs 12,500 metric tons, has a diameter of 14.6m,
    and a length of 21.6m \cite{tCmsE}.

  \section{Tracker}  
    The Silicon Tracker is the innermost sub-detector of CMS, and has active
    	elements as close as 4.4cm to the interaction point \cite{tCmsE}. 
    The tracker has a length 5.8m, a diameter of 2.6m and
    	covers a range in pseudorapidity of \(|\eta| <\) 2.5.
    Pseudorapidity is defined as $\eta\equiv-\ln(\tan(\theta/2))$, where $\theta$ is 
    	the polar angle, and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle with respect to the 
    	beam axis.
    At the center of the tracker are three rings of silicon pixels around the beam 
    	with two disks of silicon pixels to cap the rings.
    The pixel portion of the silicon tracker is comprised of 66x10$^{6}$
    	pixels.
    The silicon pixels are surrounded by silicon strips.
    The silicon strips are separated into 4 different sections: 
    	the Tracker Inner Barrel, the Tracker Inner Disk, the Tracker Outer 
    	Barrel, and the Tracker End Caps.
    The silicon strip detectors as a whole are comprised of 9.3x10$^{6}$ silicon 
    	strips.
    The high number of pixels and strips allow for the ability to distinguish
    	and collect enough distinct points to reconstruct the path of the 1000
    	or so charge particles per bunch crossing expected at peak luminosity
    	\cite{tCmsE}.  
   
  \section{ECAL}
    The next detector beyond the tracker is ECAL.
    ECAL is made of 61,200 lead tungstate (PbWO$_{4}$) crystals in the central
    	barrel and 7,324 on each of the two endcaps \cite{tCmsE}.
    The barrel (EB) covers a pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 1.479$ and has an
    	approximate $\eta-\phi$ segmentation of $0.0174\times0.0174$.
    Lead tungstate is very dense, which is reflect in the high number of interaction
    	lengths the short depth of one crystal provides.
    The crystals of the barrel have a depth of 230 mm corresponding to 25.8 
    	radiation lengths ($X_{0}$).
    The radiation length is the mean distance a high energy particle travels before
    	giving up one e-fold of kinetic energy through electromagnetic
    	interactions.
    For example, after one radiation length $E \rightarrow E/e$, where 
    	$e = 2.71828183$. 
    The endcaps (EE) cover the psuedorapitity region $1.479 < |\eta| < 3$.
    In the endcap the crystals have an exposed area of 28.62 $\times$ 28.62 
    	mm$^{2}$, and a depth of 220 mm corresponding to 24.7 $X_{0}$.
    The energy resolution of the ECAL as measured by test beam data can be seen in
    	Figure~\ref{ECALeRes}.
    \begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ECALeRes}
      \caption{The energy resolution of ECAL as a function of energy from 
    	Reference~\cite{tCmsE}.}
      \label{ECALeRes}
    \end{figure}

  \section{HCAL}
    The HCAL like the ECAL has both a barrel (HB) and endcaps (HE).
    The pseudorapidity region $|\eta|<1.3$ is covered by HB \cite{tCmsE}. 
    HB has an $\eta-\phi$ segmentation of $0.0897\times0.0897$, and is 25 times more
    	sparsely granulated than EB.
    HE covers the pseudorapidity region $1.3<|\eta|<3$.
    HE, like EE and the tracker endcaps, is aligned perpendicular to the beam axis
    	resulting in granularity that changes with $\eta$.
    In the region $1.3 <|\eta|< 1.6$ HE has an $\eta-\phi$ segmentation of 
    	$0.0897\times0.0897$.
    The $\eta-\phi$ segmentation roughly doubles to $0.17\times0.17$ in the region
    	$1.6 <|\eta|< 3$.
    The energy resolution of the barrel and endcaps can be seen in  
    	Figure~\ref{HCALeRes}.
    The thickness of the hadronic calorimeter is best described in interaction
    	lengths, the mean distance for a particle to give up an e-fold of energy
    	through nuclear interactions. 
    At $\eta = 0$ the barrel has a thickness 5.82 interaction lengths 
    	($\lambda_{I}$), and increases as the path length through the material 
    	increases to 10.6 $\lambda_{I}$ at $|\eta| = 1.3$.
    \begin{figure}[h]
      \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{HCALeRes}
      \caption{The $E_{T}$ resolution of HCAL as a function of $|\eta|$ and $E_{T}$
    	from Reference~\cite{tCmsE}.}
      \label{HCALeRes}
    \end{figure}
    
    In addition to HB and HE, HCAL has two additional calorimeters.
    Because the space between ECAL and the magnet is restricted to 1.18 m, an
    	outer hadronic calorimeter section (HO) is placed beyond the magnet
    	in the region $|\eta|<1.3$ \cite{tCmsE}.
    The main function of HO is to collect energy from the highest energy hadrons
    	before they reach the muon system.
    HO is not used in this analysis, but does contribute to the material budget. 
    To increase the total calorimetric coverage, HCAL also has a quartz fiber 
    	calorimeter (HF) in the forward region, $3 < |\eta| < 5$.
    For the majority of HF's 13 $\eta$ rings the $\eta-\phi$ segmentation is 
    	$0.175\times0.175$.
    In the lowest $|\eta|$ ring the segmentation is $0.111\times0.175$ in 
    	$\eta-\phi$.
    In the highest two $|\eta|$ rings the segmentation in $\phi$ is 0.349, with an
    	$\eta$ segmentation of 0.175 in the outer and 0.300 in the innermost 
    	ring. 
    The longitudinal direction is effectively segmented by using short fibers and
    	long fibers.
    The measure energy deposited deeper than 22 cm is measured in both the short
    	and long fibers, where as the long fibers are present throughout.
    This allows electromagnetic showers to be distinguished from purely hadronic 
    	showers \cite{tCmsE}.
    The energy resolution for HF can be seen in Figure~\ref{HCALeRes}.  
    
    Beyond HF there are two more detectors in the forward region.
    CASTOR covers the range 5.2 $< \eta <$ 6.6 on the positive side of the beam. 
    The Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) sit between the beam pipes on either side of
    	the interaction point covering the area around $\theta = 0$, $|\eta| > 
    	8.3$.
    In heavy ion collisions the ZDC has the ability to measure neutral particles 
    	that do not participate in the collision \cite{tCmsE}.
    CASTOR extends the total coverage of the CMS as whole giving more access to 
    	low-x physics \cite{tCmsE}.
    
  \section{ZDC} 
    The ZDC has a total of 18 channels.
        Half of these 18 channels are on either side of the interaction point.
    The 9 channels on the side of CMS that correspond to positive $\eta$
      are denoted ZDC$^{+}$, where as the 9 channels on the negative side are
      denoted ZDC$^{-}$.
    The 9 channels on each side are further sub-divided into an electro-magnetic  
      (EM) section and a hadronic (HAD) section.
    The EM section is positioned in front of the HAD section with respect to the 
      interaction point and is segmented transverse to the beam direction.
    The 5 EM sections are positioned in front to absorb the energy from 
      electro-magnetically induced showers, which develop over a shorter distance 
      than hadronically induced showers.
    The transverse segmentation allows for a measurement of the transverse shower
      width and the size of the beam spot at the ZDC.
    The HAD section is segmented in the direction of the beam and consists of 4
      channels.
    The longitudinal segmentation allows for absorption of the full extended 
      hadronic shower and the ability to measure the longitudinal shower shape.
    
    Each the 18 channels contains a tungsten target and quartz fibers.
    The dense tungsten target is used to initiate the shower.
    The quartz fibers shine Cerenkov light as the high momentum charged particles
      from the shower pass through it. 
    the light from the quartz fibers is channeled to photo-multiplier tubes, one 
      for each ZDC channel. 
    Through a cascade of photon induced electrical discharges, the photo-multiplier
      converts the Cerenkov light to an electrical pulse. 
    
    This electrical pulse travels $\sim$ 200 m down a coaxial cable from the LHC
      tunnel to the counting house in the CMS service cavern. 
    There the electrical pulse is digitized by the Charge Integrator and Encoder 
      (QIE).
    The QIE integrates the current each 25 nano seconds.
    The charge is than mapped logarithmically to the 128 bits. 
    This bit is sent across a small fiber optic cable to the HTR firmware card.
    Here each 25 ns signal is stored in a 250 ns buffer, and the timing is sync
      with the rest of the detector to insure the ZDC signal arrives at the central
      data acquisition system at the same time as the other sub detectors from the 
      same collision. 
    
  \section{Muons}
    The muon system resides just outside of the superconducting magnet.
    It consists of three complementary systems: drift tube (DT) chambers in the
      barrel, cathode strip chambers (CSC) in the endcaps, and resistive 
      plate chambers (RPC) in both the barrel and endcap regions \cite{tCmsE}.
    Ultimately the muon system is most useful for triggering on muons 
      and identifying tracks as muons \cite{tCmsE}.

        and the RPC stations.}
      \label{fig:muonSys}
    \end{figure}

    As seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:muonSys}, the DTs reside only in the barrel.

The heavy ion community is making use of the capabilities of CMS in a myriad of
	ways.
The muon trigger has been used in the search for suppression of quarkonium 
	states. 
This is an important probe of the correlation length within the hot dense state
	known as the quark gluon plasma (QGP).
The tracker has been utilized for to study charged particle multiplicities, and
	and elliptical flow, two probes of the thermal expansion of the QGP.
HCAL has aided in measuring jet suppression, which probes the strength with 
	which the QGP interacts with strong interacting objects.
Through its general purpose design and its ability to handle the high
	multiplicities produce by the LHC, CMS proves to be an excellent 
	detector for investigating strongly interacting mater through heavy ion
	collisions. 

  \section{Trigger}
    The CMS trigger is two tiered. 
    The L1 trigger is the lower level hardware based system. 
    The High Level Trigger (HLT) is software base and runs on a computer farm
      at point 5 where CMS is housed.

    The purpose of the L1 trigger is to make quick decisions about which events
      will be kept temporarily for for further processing.
    The L1 trigger is used to identify events where the tracker should be read
      out.
    Only the calorimeters and the muon system are used in the L1 trigger.
    Each of the sub-detectors has it's triggering hardware.
    The output from the sub-detectors is synchronized to ensure that the signal
      from each of the sub-detectors comes from the same collision. 
    The global trigger hardware then makes the final decision to initiate the 
      HLT and to read out the tracker. 

    If an event passes the L1 trigger, the data from all the sub-detectors in
      including the Tracker are sent to the HLT computing farm. 
    At this level the raw data from all the sub-detectors is unpacked and 
      combined.
    The information from the calorimeters, muon system, and tracker can all 
      be used to reconstruct basic physic objects in the HLT farm. 
    For example, tracks can be combined with either ECAL energy clusters to 
      form electron candidates, tracks can be combined with hits in the muon
      system to create muon candidates.
    At the HLT the whole detector is used together to select events.
    The raw data from the events that survive the HLT are recorded permanently,
      those that do not are lost forever. 

    The HLT farm must always be ready to accept events from the L1 trigger.
    For this reason, the amount of computing time each HLT trigger path uses
      must be balanced.
    For more rare L1 triggers, which will occur at a lower rate, more 
      complex reconstruction software can be used.
    Conversely, simpler, faster, methods must be used for more common high
      rate triggers. 
    Because of this time constraint in the HLT farm, the reconstruction 
      algorithms used for triggering tended to differ from the final 
      reconstruction algorithms.
    In the HLT these algorithms are optimized for quickness, whereas the final 
      reconstruction is optimized for precision and accuracy.
    By having the ability to spend different amounts of computing time on 
      different L1 triggered events, the complexity of the event selection 
      offered by the HLT is heightened. 

    The two tiered triggering system creates very low dead times while 
      maintaining purity and selectivity.
    During data taking the L1 trigger is continuously monitoring, and the HLT
      allows for sophisticated event selection.
    The wide gamete of physics topics that are pursued by the CMS collaboration
      are a testament to the effectiveness and versatility of the CMS two 
      tiered triggering system.
