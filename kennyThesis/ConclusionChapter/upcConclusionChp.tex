\chapter{Summary}	
  Ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions provide an opportunity to study 
    the nature of the initial state. 
  Model calculations of the nuclear gluon density can be constrained by 
    studying quarkonia photoproduction at the LHC.
  In this thesis, the coherent \JPsi{} photoproduction cross section in 
    ultra-peripheral PbPb collisions at $sqrt(s_{NN})$ = 2.76 TeV.
  This was done by analysing data from the 2011 PbPb run recorded by the CMS 
    detector.
  A brief description of the detector apparatus was presented in this thesis.
  A special set of triggers was developed for the analysis in this thesis.
  These events are characterized by low \pt{} dimuons.
  Although the CMS detector was not designed to study this type of event, the
    analysis in this thesis demonstrates how versatile CMS can be at handling 
    both low \pt{} and low multiplicity events. 
  However, this analysis suffers from small statistics. 
  This is due to low acceptance for triggering on low \pt{} muons as well as 
    the difficulty to trigger these muons in coincidence with neutrons in the 
    ZDC.
