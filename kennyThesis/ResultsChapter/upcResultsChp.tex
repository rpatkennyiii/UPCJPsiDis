\chapter{Results} 
  The main results of this thesis are give here:
    the cross section for coherent \JPsi~production, the incoherent \JPsi~cross
    section, the cross section for muon pairs from photon-photon interactions,
    the ratio between break up mode yields, and the rapidity correlations 
    between dimuon candidates and neutrons in the ZDC.

  \section{Coherent cross section}
  The coherent cross section in calculated from the following equation:
  \begin{equation}
    \frac{d\sigma^{J/\psi}_{co}}{dy}  = \frac{N_{cor} f_{co}  }
    { \Delta y\mathcal{L}_{int} \varepsilon_{ZDC} \varepsilon_{p_{T}} 
      BR_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}}
    \label{eq:expXSecCo}
   \end{equation}
   where $N_{cor}$ is corrected dimuon yield, $f_{co}$ is the 
     fraction of events that come from the coherent process, 
     $BR_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}$ is the branching ratio for \JPsi~to $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$, 
     $\varepsilon_{ZDC}$ is the efficiency for triggering the ZDC, 
     $\varepsilon_{p_{T}}$ is the efficiency for the 0.15 GeV cut in $p_{T}$, 
     $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ is the integrated luminosity, and $\Delta y$ is the 
     width the rapidity interval.

  The raw yield of dimuon candidates was measured after applying the cuts 
    described in Section~\ref{sec:DataSetEvSel}.

    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{rawYield}
    \caption{Raw yield for the Coherent cross section measurement.}
    \label{fig:rawYieldCo}
  \end{figure}
  $N_{cor}$ was calculated by dividing the raw yields from 
    Fig.~\ref{fig:rawYieldCo} by the acceptance and efficiency factor from 
    Fig.~\ref{fig:avAccEff}, which combines $A$ and 
    $\varepsilon^{dimuon}_{trigger}$ as described in Section.~\ref{sec:effDet}.
  The corrected yields, $N_{cor}$, are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:corYieldCo}.
  \begin{figure}[!Hhtb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{correctedYieldAverage}
    \caption{Corrected yields for the coherent p$_{T}$ region.}
    \label{fig:corYieldCo}
  \end{figure}
  For the coherent cross section measurement, $N_{cor}$ is taken from the 
    region 2.0 < $|y|$ < 2.2 and $p_{T}$ < 0.15 GeV to avoid the edges of the
    detectors acceptance, bin migration in the calculation of $A$, and overlap
    between the coherent and incoherent process.
  From this procedure, the $N_{cor}$ was measured to be 1903.
  
  To measure $f_{co}$, the simultaneous fit shown in 
    Fig.~\ref{fig:simFitMassPtGauss} was used.
  The normalizations for each of the three components to the signal are fixed 
  by the fit as described in Section~\ref{sec:sigEx}.
  The normalized coherent template is integrated up to 0.15 GeV in $p_{T}$ and
    divided by the integral of the data $p_{T}$ spectrum up to 0.15 GeV.
  The statistical error taken from the fit, $f_{co}$ = 0.60 $\pm$ 0.11.

  The two efficiency terms, $\varepsilon_{ZDC}$ and $\varepsilon_{p_{T}}$, were
    measured from data and MC respectively.
  As described in Section~\ref{sec:breakUpDet}, $\varepsilon_{ZDC}$ was 
    measured in the from the ZDC triggered data set by dividing the number of 
    events both fire the ZDC trigger and pass the one neutron threshold.
  $\varepsilon_{ZDC}$ was measured to be 0.96 with a negligible statistical 
    error.
  The efficiency of the 0.15 GeV $p_{T}$ cut was estimated from MC by dividing 
    the number of events that are lost by applying the $p_{T}$ cut after all
    other cuts are applied. 
  From this method $\varepsilon_{p_{T}}$ = 0.95.
  
  The remaining two terms, $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ and $BR_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}$, 
    depend on Ref.~\cite{cmsLumi} and Ref.~\cite{pdg}.
  Ref.~\cite{cmsLumi} describes the method of using activity in HF to measure 
    the luminosity. 
  From this method, $\mathcal{L}_{int}$ was measured to be 143.3$\mu b^{-1}\pm$7.2.
  $BR_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}$ from Ref.~\cite{pdg} is 0.0593 $\pm$ 0.0006.
  From Equation~\ref{eq:expXSecCo}, $\frac{d\sigma^{J/\psi}_{co}}{dy}$ = 368 $mb$.

  \section{Incoherent cross section}
  The same basic procedure for measuring the coherent cross section was used to 
    calculate the incoherent cross section.  
  \section{Break up ratios}
    In Table~\ref{tab:r2} the ratio between raw yields for different break up 
      modes are shown.

  \section{diMuon-neutron correlations}
    In this section the correlation between the rapidity of the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ 
      and of the neutron is studied. The following samples are studied: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\gamma + A$ collisions in which two cases are considered
      \begin{itemize}
        \item elastic coherent interaction: here photon interacts with entier
          nucleus coherently and produce \JPsi. 
          Another photon is needed to cause the breakup and neutron emission. 
          Those two photons are uncorrelated and thus we don't expect to 
            observe the correlation between the rapidity of the neutron and the
            rapidity of the \JPsi.
          In the data sample this corresponds to the low-\pt \JPsi 
            (\pt$<$0.15~GeV). 
        \item inelastic incoherent interaction: here a single high \pt photoni
          interacting with nucleus produce the \JPsi and neutron. 
          The correlation between the rapidity of the neutron and the rapidity
            of the \JPsi is expected.
          In the data sample this corresponds to the high-\pt \JPsi 
            (0.15$<$\pt$<$1.05). 
      \end{itemize}
      \item $\gamma \gamma$ collisions: two photons collide and produce the 
        $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$  and the third photon is needed to excite one of
          the nucleons and produce neutron. 
        Thus we don't expect to see the correlation between the rapidity of the
          neutron and the rapidity of the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. 
        In the data sample this corresponds to the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ with the
          invariant mass between 4 and 8~GeV. 
    \end{itemize}

    In order to study the correlation in rapidity between the neutron and
      dimuon direction we below four quantities and give they values in 
      Table~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi}.  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{-}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y<0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{-}$ ($y<0$)
      \item $y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{+}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y<0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{+}$ ($y>0$)
      \item $y^{+}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{+}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y>0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{+}$ ($y>0$)
      \item $y^{+}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{-}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y>0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{-}$ ($y<0$)
    \end{itemize}

    The ratio $R_{opp/same}$ is defined as: 
    \begin{equation}
      R_{opp/same} = \frac{y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{+} + y^{+}_{\mu\mu} 
        \wedge y_{n}^{-}}{y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{-} + y^{+}_{\mu\mu} 
        \wedge y_{n}^{+}}
    \end{equation}
    
    Ratios studied in this section are only sensitive to the difference between
      the ZDC$^{-}$ and ZDC$^{-}$.
    It is seen that the efficiency of both ZDCs in not exactly the same i.e.
      the efficiencies of ZDC$^{-}$ and ZDC$^{+}$ are respectively 
      $\varepsilon_{ZDC^{-}}$=0.98 and  $\varepsilon_{ZDC^{+}}$=0.94 and this 
      is taken in the account in the estimations. 
    The $R_{opp/same}$ radio corrected by the ZDCs efficiencies is also 
      included in Table~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi} and called 
      $R_{opp/same}^{\varepsilon_{ZDC}}$. 
    It is seen that the difference between corrected and uncorrected results is
      very small. 
    Other uncertainties cancel. 
    In this case cuts related to the acceptance and efficiencies corrections 
      are not necessary and thus they are released.
    
    Figure~\ref{fig:PtcorrandRation} gives \pt distributions of the \JPsi 
      when \JPsi and neutron have the opposite rapidity direction or when they 
      have the same rapidity direction for low-\pt and high-\pt \JPsi. 
    Also the Fig~\ref{fig:PtcorrandRation} gives the $R_{opp/same}$ for low-\pt
      and high-\pt \JPsi. 
    In is send from this plot that in the case of the low-\pt \JPsi this 
      $R_{opp/same}$ ratio is close to 1 and is decreasing when the \pt of
      \JPsi increases.

    Another, interesting correlation between the \JPsi rapidity direction and

    From the Tab~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi} and the Fig.~\ref{fig:rNeutDimuCorr} 
      it is seen as expected that there is no correlation between the \JPsi 
      rapidity and neutron rapidity in the case of the low-\pt \JPsi and 
      dimuons coming from $\gamma \gamma$ sample. 
    In the case of the high-\pt \JPsi the correlation is clearly visible.
