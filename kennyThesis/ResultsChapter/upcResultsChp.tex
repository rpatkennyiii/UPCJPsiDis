\chapter{Results and summary}
  In the previous two chapters the analysis steps to measure the coherent
    \JPsi{} photoproduction were given.
  In this chapter, the measured cross section for this process is given
    in Section~\ref{sec:jpCoRes}.
  Comparisons to the theoretical models are discussed. 
  In addition, the rapidity correlation between UPC \JPsi{} and forward
    neutrons are presented and compared to model calculations in 
    Section~\ref{sec:upcCor}. 
  Finally, a summary of the complete thesis is given.  
  
  \section{Coherent \JPsi{} cross section\label{sec:jpCoRes}}
%
 The coherent \JPsi{} cross section is calculated using the following formula:
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma^{J/\psi}_{coh}}{dy} (Xn0n)= \frac{N^{J/\psi}_{coh}}{\mathcal{L} \cdot (2 \cdot \Delta y )\cdot BR}~\textrm{,}
\label{eq:expXSecCo}
\end{equation}
%
where $N^{J/\psi}_{coh}$ is the corrected number of coherent $J/\psi$ candidates,  $\mathcal{L}$ is the integrated luminosity used for
this analysis, $\Delta y$ is the width of the rapidity interval, and $BR$ is the branching ratio for \JPsi{} to $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. To obtain $N^{J/\psi}_{coh}$ the following
formula was used  
%
\begin{equation}
N^{J/\psi}_{coh}(Xn0n) = \frac{N^{J/\psi}_{yield}}{(A\times \varepsilon) \cdot \varepsilon^{ZDC}_{trig} \cdot \varepsilon^{J/\psi}_{trig}}~\textrm{,}
\end{equation}
%
where $N^{J/\psi}_{yield}$ is the $J/\psi$ yield with a $p_{T} <$ 0.15 GeV, $A\times \varepsilon$ is the combined acceptance and efficiency, $\varepsilon^{ZDC}_{trig}$ is the ZDC triggering efficiency for detecting at least one neutron emitted in the forward region, and $\varepsilon^{J/\psi}_{trig}$ is the $J/\psi$ trigger efficiency measured by the ``tag and probe" method. Each of these quantities can be found in Table~\ref{tab:nJpCoh}.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{\label{tab:nJpCoh}}
\end{table}  

The coherent J/$\psi$ cross section $\frac{d\sigma^{J/\psi}_{coh}}{dy} (Xn0n)$ includes the emission of at least one neutron emitted, Xn0n. Previous measurements carried 
by the ALICE Collaboration measured the cross section without any break-up requirement. In order to compare to their results, the cross section is scaled by the 
factor 5.06 to account for the increase in cross section. This value was obtained from STARlight. The resulting cross section is \textcolor{blue}{X $\pm$ Y}.

Figure~X shows the measured cross section compared to the ALICE data points, as well as STARligh, AB and LTA models (see Chapter~\ref{ch:photoNuc}. The measured cross section is in agreement with previous measurements, and favors the AB-EPS09 model. Given the measured cross section is significantly below STARlight, nuclear gluon shadowing plays an important role for $x\sim$ 10$^{-2}$. 

  \section{\JPsi{} neutron correlations~\label{sec:upcCor}}
    In this section the correlation between the rapidity of the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ 
      and of the neutron is studied. The following samples are studied: 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\gamma + A$ collisions in which two cases are considered
      \begin{itemize}
        \item elastic coherent interaction: here photon interacts with entire
          nucleus coherently and produce \JPsi. 
          Another photon is needed to cause the breakup and neutron emission. 
          Those two photons are uncorrelated and thus we don't expect to 
            observe the correlation between the rapidity of the neutron and the
            rapidity of the \JPsi.
          In the data sample this corresponds to the low-\pt \JPsi 
            (\pt$<$0.15~GeV). 
        \item inelastic incoherent interaction: here a single high \pt photons
          interacting with nucleus produce the \JPsi and neutron. 
          The correlation between the rapidity of the neutron and the rapidity
            of the \JPsi is expected.
          In the data sample this corresponds to the high-\pt \JPsi 
            (0.15$<$\pt$<$1.05). 
      \end{itemize}
      \item $\gamma \gamma$ collisions: two photons collide and produce the 
        $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$  and the third photon is needed to excite one of
          the nucleons and produce neutron. 
        Thus we don't expect to see the correlation between the rapidity of the
          neutron and the rapidity of the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$. 
        In the data sample this corresponds to the $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ with the
          invariant mass between 4 and 8~GeV. 
    \end{itemize}

    In order to study the correlation in rapidity between the neutron and
      dimuon direction we below four quantities and give they values in 
      Table~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi}.  
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{-}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y<0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{-}$ ($y<0$)
      \item $y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{+}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y<0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{+}$ ($y>0$)
      \item $y^{+}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{+}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y>0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{+}$ ($y>0$)
      \item $y^{+}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{-}$: number of $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ having
         $y>0$ and the neutron in ZDC$^{-}$ ($y<0$)
    \end{itemize}

    The ratio $R_{opp/same}$ is defined as: 
    \begin{equation}
      R_{opp/same} = \frac{y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{+} + y^{+}_{\mu\mu} 
        \wedge y_{n}^{-}}{y^{-}_{\mu\mu} \wedge y_{n}^{-} + y^{+}_{\mu\mu} 
        \wedge y_{n}^{+}}
    \end{equation}
    
    Ratios studied in this section are only sensitive to the difference between
      the ZDC$^{-}$ and ZDC$^{-}$.
    It is seen that the efficiency of both ZDCs in not exactly the same i.e.
      the efficiencies of ZDC$^{-}$ and ZDC$^{+}$ are respectively 
      $\varepsilon_{ZDC^{-}}$=0.98 and  $\varepsilon_{ZDC^{+}}$=0.94 and this 
      is taken in the account in the estimations. 
    The $R_{opp/same}$ radio corrected by the ZDCs efficiencies is also 
      included in Table~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi} and called 
      $R_{opp/same}^{\varepsilon_{ZDC}}$. 
    It is seen that the difference between corrected and uncorrected results is
      very small. 
    Other uncertainties cancel. 
    In this case cuts related to the acceptance and efficiencies corrections 
      are not necessary and thus they are released.
    
    Figure~\ref{fig:PtcorrandRation} gives \pt distributions of the \JPsi 
      when \JPsi and neutron have the opposite rapidity direction or when they 
      have the same rapidity direction for low-\pt and high-\pt \JPsi. 
    Also the Fig~\ref{fig:PtcorrandRation} gives the $R_{opp/same}$ for low-\pt
      and high-\pt \JPsi. 
    In is send from this plot that in the case of the low-\pt \JPsi this 
      $R_{opp/same}$ ratio is close to 1 and is decreasing when the \pt of
      \JPsi increases.

    Another, interesting correlation between the \JPsi rapidity direction and 
      the neutron rapidity can be also studied with quantities defined in 
      Eq.~\ref{eq:Ration} that are calculated in the 
      Table~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi}. 
    Table~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsieffcorr} gives the same quantities as  
      Table.~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi} but here it is corrected for the 
      difference between the efficiency of the ZDC$^{+}$ and  ZDC$^{-}$. 
    
    \begin{equation}
      \label{eq:Ration}

    Integrated over rapidity, separately for $y<0$ and $y>0$ ratios from

          from $\gamma \gamma$ sample. }

    \end{figure*}
    
    From the Tab~\ref{tab:corrneutronjpsi} and the Fig.~\ref{fig:rNeutDimuCorr} 
      it is seen as expected that there is no correlation between the \JPsi 
      rapidity and neutron rapidity in the case of the low-\pt \JPsi and 
      dimuons coming from $\gamma \gamma$ sample. 
    In the case of the high-\pt \JPsi the correlation is clearly visible.

  \section{Incoherent cross section}
  The same basic procedure for measuring the coherent cross section was used to 
    calculate the incoherent cross section.  
  \section{Break up ratios}
    In Table~\ref{tab:r2} the ratio between raw yields for different break up 
      modes are shown.

  \section{\label{sec:summary}Summary}
    As physicists' understanding of the QGP has deepened over the past 30 years
      of doing experimental heavy ion physics, the questions surrounding the
      QGP have shift from the confirmation of creation of a deconfined state
      to understanding the properties of the state that is created.
    It appears that the QGP is a hot nearly viscosity free fluid of strongly 
      coupled quarks and gluons. 
    The control measurements from dAu collisions at RHIC, and pPb collisions
      at the LHC have shown signs of collective behavior such as flow, which 
      made these results difficult to interpret.
    Additional knowledge of the initial state of the colliding nuclei is needed
      in order to fully understand the QGP signal seen in PbPb and AuAu 
      collisions.
    UPC events can provide this needed knowledge. 
    This thesis contributes to the understanding of the initial state through
      the measurement of the UPC \JPsi{} photoproduction cross section. 
  
    Ultra-peripheral collisions are clean probe of the initial state. 
    In UPC \JPsi{} photoproduction, the nuclei interact through the 
      electromagnetic force precluding the possibility of creating a collective
      medium.
    The theoretical models of coherent UPC \JPsi{} photoproduction model these 
      electromagnetic interactions by combining a semi-classical calculation 
      of the photon flux with a variety of phenomenological and QCD based 
      calculations of the nuclear gluon density. 
    The Weis\"{a}cker-Williams approximation \cite{WWFermi} is used to calculate 
      the flux of photons that surround the colliding nuclei. 
    The interaction of these photons with the nucleus is either calculated 
      through a nuclear modification of the proton gluon density 
      \cite{pQCD2013.02, lta2012.03}, or by using the Glauber model approach 
      that consists in modeling the nucleus as a collection
      of nucleons and scaling the nucleon photoproduction cross sections from 
      e-p collisions \cite{vmd1999}. 
    Photoproduction cross sections from from UPC events can determine at what 
      energy scale the Glauber based method breaks down.
    For the gluon density based calculations, there is a wide discrepancy
      between the predictions, and photoproduction cross sections constrain which
      gluon density models are viable. 
  
    In this thesis, the CMS detector was used to measure the coherent UPC \JPsi{} 
      photoproduction cross section.
    The three major subsystems of CMS were used, the tracker, 
      the muon system, the calorimeter system.
    The tracker records the position charge excitations in the silicon due to 
      particle hits, which are used to reconstruct the trajectory of charged 
      particles. 
    The muon system is comprised of the three gaseous detectors, the DTs, the 
      RPC, and the CSCs, which record charge deposits as high momentum particles
      ionize the gas within the detector.
    The muon system primary purpose is for triggering on and identifying muons.
    The calorimeter system measures the energy of deposited by particle induced
      showers as a means of reconstructing neutral particles and jets.
    
    The analysis in this thesis consists of three major components, development
      of a trigger, estimation of efficiency, and measurement of signal events.
    The trigger development involved designing a trigger based on rate estimates
      from past data that ensured a sample that could be used for both measuring
      the signal and estimate the efficiency of the trigger, reconstruction, and
      event selection.
    The number of \JPsi{} candidates was measured by first applying a set 
      of event selection cuts that rejected background events such as hadronic
      collisions and beam gas collisions, then fitting the remaining events to
      templates from simulation to separate the three remaining physics processes,
      the coherent, incoherent, and photon-photon process.
    The efficiencies for each part of the trigger were measured from data. 
    The acceptance and reconstruction efficiency were estimated from MC.
    The cross section was calculated by combining the efficiency with the 
      measured luminosity and number of coherent \JPsi{}.
    The statistical uncertainties were taken from the template fit.
    The systematic uncertainties were estimated by varying the method used on 
      each component of the analysis. 
  
    The UPC \JPsi{} photoproduction cross section, $\frac{d\sigma^{J/\psi}_{co}}{dy}$,
      was found to be \textcolor{red}{368 $\pm$ 38 $\mu$b}. 
    When rescaled by a factor of 5.06 to account for the difference of break-up mode between 
      the measurement in this thesis and the ALICE result in~\cite{Abelev:2012ba,Abbas:2013oua}, the 
      result of \textcolor{red}{1.86 $\pm$ 19 mb} was found to be consistent with the 
      predictions in \cite{pQCD2013.02} of \textcolor{red}{1.8 mb}.  
    The calculation in \cite{pQCD2013.02} is also favored by the ALICE measurements. 
    Of the gluon distributions used in \cite{pQCD2013.02}, a gluon distribution with 
      moderately strong gluon shadowing, EPS09~\cite{Eskola:2009uj}, is consistent with both the results from this
      thesis and the previous ALICE results. 
    This indicates that at the scale of the mass of the \JPsi{} the nucleus gluon density is 
      significantly suppressed compared to the gluon densities of a nucleon.
    At this scale the nucleus can not be represented as a collection of nucleons as in the 
      Glauber like model described in \cite{vmd1999}.
  
    The measurement in this thesis confirms the ability to increase the knowledge of the 
      initial state through the exploration of UPC events. 
    This confirmation opens the door to additional measurements in this growing field of UPC
      research.
    A whole host of measurements will be possible with the data already recorded,
      and with that to recorded in the coming years by CMS and the other LHC 
      experiments.
